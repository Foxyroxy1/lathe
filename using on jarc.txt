On Jarc, a few things have to be defined or redefined before loading
Lathe. Specifically:


The 'down macro must be defined according to its Arc 3.1 arc.arc
functionality, but changed to use 'set, '=, or 'xassign instead of
'assign, since Jarc hasn't renamed 'set to 'assign yet.

The 'enq macro should be defined in such a way that it uses something
like (++ (car:cddr q)) rather than (++ (q 2)), since Jarc doesn't
define sref on lists.

The 'split and 'or= definitions need to be taken from Arc 3.1's
arc.arc.

All of Arc 3.1's strings.arc should be loaded. Only a few definitions
are needed, but we might as well take them all.


After that, define lathe-dir* and load loadfirst.arc as directed in
the readme.
