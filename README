Lathe is meant to be a collection of utility libraries that don't
really have a specific purpose other than to make their host language
smoother to program in (at least according to one opinion). In
particular, I'm starting it up so that I have somewhere to post little
things I'm doing in Arc, so that I can talk about them at the Arc
forum. Other languages are not off-limits.

Right now, this only contains a very young Arc module system based on
renaming of global variables (arc/modules/), one example of a library
that uses the module system (arc/amb.arc), and one very small example
of loading that library using the module system
(arc/examples/module-demo.arc), which doubles as the only test case to
date.

The examples (and therefore the test) don't cover everything the
module system and the library have to offer. The code is fairly well
commented, so reading those comments is probably the best way to get a
feel for things.


== Setup in Arc ==

The code in the arc/ directory is targeted mainly at Arc 3.1, which
you can download at http://ycombinator.com/arc/arc3.1.tar. Arc 3.1
itself depends on MzScheme. For more detailed help setting up Arc,
including how to adjust it to work on Windows, arclanguage.org is a
good resource.

Besides the official Arc 3.1, two other Arc setups are supported: The
Anarki fork (http://github.com/nex3/arc) and the Java-based
interpreter Rainbow (http://github.com/conanite/rainbow).

To use the code, add this to your libs.arc (here assuming you put the
contents of the Lathe arc/ folder into lib/lathe/ in your Arc setup):

  (= lathe-dir* "lib/lathe/")
  (load:+ lathe-dir* "loadfirst.arc")

The lathe-dir* global variable is necessary; the loadfirst.arc code
uses it to determine where to load other lathe files from.
